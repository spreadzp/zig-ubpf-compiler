/** @brief Add an entry to the given patchable relative table.
 *
 * Emitting an entry into the patchable relative table means that resolution of the target
 * address can be postponed until all the instructions are emitted. Note: This function does
 * not emit any instructions -- it simply updates metadata to guide resolution after code generation.
 * _target_pc_ is in eBPF instruction units and _manual_target_offset_ is in JIT'd instruction
 * units. In other words, setting _target_pc_ instead of _manual_target_offset_ will guide
 * the resolution algorithm to find the JIT'd code that corresponds to the eBPF instruction
 * (as the jump target); alternatively, setting _manual_target_offset_ will direct the
 * resolution algorithm to find the JIT'd instruction at that offset (as the target).
 *
 * @param[in] offset The offset in the JIT'd code where the to-be-resolved target begins.
 * @param[in] target_pc The offset of the eBPF instruction targeted by the jump.
 * @param[in] manual_target_offset The offset of the JIT'd instruction targeted by the jump.
 *                                 A non-zero value for this parameter overrides _target_pc_`.
 * @param[in] table The relative patchable table to update.
 * @param[in] index A spot in the _table_ to add/update according to the given parameters.
 * @param[in] near Whether the target is relatively near the jump.
